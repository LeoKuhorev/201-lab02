## Welcome to my Code Fellows 201 Lab 02 project

### Short features description:
- you can enter user name in the top right corner (unfortunately it won't be saved after you refresh the page);
- if you want to find out more facts about me you can play a funny question game. To do that just click on "play" button and follow the prompts;
- questions, correct answers and messages are stored in 3 different arrays, the questions will be shown in random order. The program checks the type of the answer and starts corresponding lines of code to validate user entry; 
- if new questions added to the array the random iteration and indexes will work just fine, some of the messages still need to be adjusted, though, so that they show only relevant to the question info);
